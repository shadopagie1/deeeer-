There is a light story to guide you through the game but this really only serves as a distraction. You can knock over planters, hop aboard a person to run around and punch others, and even sit atop a massive koala bear. 't enough, you can even run on water and smash buttons to spawn in other animals. However, if and when things get out of hand, a bunch of polar bears and sheep will attack you until you meet your demise. This is all in a day"},

One minigame is a sort of board game called Cowthello. It's quite hard to describe this game but you essentially need to move your cow pieces around a board. Games like this are a fun distraction, however, the best mini-game might be basketball. Yep, you can prance onto a basketball court, pick up some basketballs, and shoot some hoops with a bunch of cows who are also hanging out there. The plethora of side activities in this game is staggering."},

What's shocking is the staggering amount of creatures you can actually ride. There are most basic ones like horses or zebras, but you can also ride fish and rhinos. Easily the most bizarre and most fun animal to ride is the cow. Now, you don't simply ride the cow as you would think. Instead, you grab onto the cow who then blasts up into the air with milk spewing from its utter. This game basically gives you a cow jetpack. That gameplay mechanic alone should plaster a huge smile on your fac"
